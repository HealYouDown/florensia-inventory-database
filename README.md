## Usage
Download the .exe from [Releases](https://github.com/HealYouDown/florensia-inventory-database/releases) and run it while having Florensia open. It will then, after about 10-20 seconds, create an excel file with all items for this character.

If you run the file for a second time on another character, it will update the existing excel file, if it is still at the same location.
